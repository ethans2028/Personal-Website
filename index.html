            <p>
              As an IT Support Agent for my university, I have handled hundreds of technical support 
              requests and managed our asset inventory of 1000+ devices. Facing a variety of customer 
              issues has taught me to use Atlassian tools like Jira and Confluence as well as 
              collaborate with colleagues to solve problems. I am now one of the most senior members 
              of our student employee team and have taken up a mentorship role.

            <p>
              During my time at Seoulz.com, I was the sole programmer and tasked with making their workflow more
              efficient. I met with the co-founders biweekly to better grasp their business objectives and system 
              requirements, listening intently, and asking clarifying questions. To succeed, I developed 
              my project schedule, estimated its duration, and provided status reports. The result was 
              their first scalable and automated order management system developed using the agile 
              framework, which reduced overall time for their workflow process and errors caused by 
              manual tracking. In addition, I streamlined their workflow by identifying an unneeded 3rd 
              party database and migrating client data to an in-house application, reducing overhead expenses.

            <h2>Oakland Kids Community</h2>
            <h2>2020-Present</h2>

            <p>
              As a founder of the non-profit organization Oakland Kids Community, I made it my goal to 
              empower people of all ages to invest in their community through kid-friendly events. Our 
              first event consisted of hosting a community cleanup project, beautifying my neighborhood, 
              and raising over $600 for a local swim team. The proceeds helped to purchase a canopy for 
              shelter during meets and a team banner, affecting over 150+ swimmers and their families. 
              At Seattle University, I have continued an active leadership role in the community 
              by becoming the Vice President of the Chinese Student Association for the 2021-22 school 
              year.
